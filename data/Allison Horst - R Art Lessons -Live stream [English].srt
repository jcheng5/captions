00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:06,760
ALLISON HORST: Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,010
I'm Allison Horst.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm an assistant teaching
professor at the Bren

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,820
School at UC Santa Barbara.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,380
And over the past
year, I've also

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,840
been RStudio's
artist in residence.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,030
In this talk, I'm really
excited to share with you

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,720
some of the motivation behind my
R artwork and also some lessons

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,400
I've learned from the R
community along the way.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,230
To get started,
I want to ask you

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,460
to think about what did it feel
like for you the first time you

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,590
started learning R. Maybe you
are one of the lucky ones where

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,870
all you felt was
happiness and excitement

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,250
and you knew this was going to
be an awesome tool to learn.

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,380
But for many people
who are learning

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,060
R or code for the first time,
that's not the reaction.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,880
There can be some
confusion at the idea

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,170
of learning this new language.

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,530
There can be some
frustration, maybe you

20
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,140
are already happily working
in another language,

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,620
and you're looking at R thinking
like, what is the kakapo?

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,380
I want my pandas back.

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,680
Maybe you are feeling
frustrated as you try to get up

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,900
this steep learning curve.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,820
Or maybe you weren't
even expecting

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,100
to have to learn how
to code, and you're

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,010
looking at R just having a
meltdown because it's something

28
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,590
that's so completely new.

29
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,920
And all of these feelings are
pretty common for learners,

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,790
and this isn't unique to R. A
recent Google search for why

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,130
is coding so dot,
dot, dot reveals

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,000
that a lot of the top searches
related to why is coding so

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,880
are not totally positive.

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,640
Why is coding so hard,
so boring, complicated,

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,680
frustrating, difficult,
hard to learn,

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,540
confusing, and stressful?

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,600
And yes, mixed in here there's
some good ones like, why

38
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,160
is coding so important?

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,110
And why is coding so fun?

40
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,320
That might be an artifact of
this being part of my search

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,730
results.

42
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,030
But the overall takeaway is
that for a lot of learners,

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,070
R and learning to
code in general

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,440
can feel a little
bit intimidating

45
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,320
and maybe not like a
totally happy place.

46
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,030
And not only can it feel
a little bit intimidating,

47
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,390
but it's also a big energy
and time investment.

48
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,370
There are so many
things to learn

49
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,260
to get started in R and
with coding in general,

50
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,250
and there's always
something new coming out.

51
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,620
For those of us who are
happily working in R,

52
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,770
maybe we are this green
monster on the right where

53
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,820
we see new tutorials and
new resources or packages

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,070
coming out every
day, and we are so

55
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,680
excited knowing that it can
be something useful for us

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,600
to learn and use.

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,090
But we can imagine that
for learners, who are just

58
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,743
trying to get up this steep
learning curve, seeing all

59
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:47,160
of those new things
coming out all

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,900
the time could be a
little bit daunting.

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,400
So what can we do when
something is hard to learn

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,210
and we're asking a learner
to make an investment?

63
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,100
One thing that we
can do is we can

64
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,930
put in a little
bit of extra work

65
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,480
to help something
that originally

66
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,320
doesn't look that appetizing
feel a little bit more

67
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,370
appetizing.

68
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,340
For example, if we know
that vegetables contain

69
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,680
a lot of really great
nutrients, but it's

70
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,630
hard to convince
somebody to eat them,

71
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,720
maybe we can dress it up
to look like a cute bug

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,850
to make it more likely
that they will invest

73
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,360
in eating those vegetables.

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,480
And people are already
doing this in code.

75
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,840
For example, Julia
Evans' zines that

76
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,830
explained a lot of really
important basics in CSS

77
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,030
and Git, and bash are a
really useful teaching tools

78
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,390
because they provide
information for learners,

79
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,000
but they also make it
look very welcoming.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,500
These look like a thing that
I would want to engage with.

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,570
And I found myself
wondering when

82
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,410
I was teaching courses in R to
graduate students, most of who

83
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,360
had never coded before, do
those resources exist in R?

84
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,320
Are there nice, welcoming,
engaging illustrations

85
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,630
that I can include in
my course materials?

86
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,480
There would be a welcoming
entryway for graduate students

87
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,150
to learn new functions
and packages.

88
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,850
Because what I found was
that I would be up there

89
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,160
in the front of a
class so excited

90
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,190
to introduce an
amazing new function

91
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,839
and on the screen
behind me would

92
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,920
be a screenshot of the
documentation, which contains

93
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,720
a lot of really
important information

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,690
that's going to be essential
moving forward, but maybe

95
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,320
was not the most inspiring
first interaction

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,070
that a student could have
with a new function, which

97
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,620
made me think, yes,
there is a place

98
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,680
to create engaging
artwork that dresses up

99
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,500
R a little bit to make it look
more inviting and welcoming.

100
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,990
And over the past
year, that has been

101
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,560
my entire goal as RStudio's
artist in residence,

102
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,980
has been to create useful
and engaging illustrations

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,740
that welcome users to
explore, teach, and learn

104
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,530
about new packages
and functions in R.

105
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,290
And they will still have to
go on to eat their vegetables

106
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,190
and learn those hard skills,
but the first interaction

107
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,000
could be something that is fun
and positive and welcoming.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
So for example, instead of
their first view of mutate

109
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,600
being a screenshot
of the documentation,

110
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,380
maybe instead their first
interaction with mutate

111
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,590
could be seeing these
helpful X-Men monsters

112
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:30,680
adding a new column to
an existing data frame.

113
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,540
And over the past
year, I've not only

114
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,770
been creating many illustrations
as a welcoming interaction

115
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,650
with different functions
and packages in R,

116
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,900
but I've also created
illustrations showing

117
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,690
general data science
principles and concepts

118
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,290
and also a whole
bunch of hex stickers.

119
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,000
But what I want
to talk about now

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,670
is what I've learned from the
R community over the past year.

121
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,190
And these have been really
important lessons for me

122
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,340
as an artist and as a
data science teacher.

123
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,710
And the first thing
that the R community

124
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,300
has helped me to embrace is
that cute and credible artwork

125
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,830
coexist.

126
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,810
Just like Bailey,
the golden retriever,

127
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,720
is sitting here looking totally
credible and professional

128
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,990
while he develops his
R package, he also

129
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,780
is looking very adorable.

130
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,200
And that can happen
with artwork too.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
And even though I knew
this, even though I

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,580
knew that making and
including artwork

133
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,090
could be really useful for
effective communication making

134
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,090
slides more engaging,
connecting to learners

135
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,360
and clarifying concepts,
showing empathy, lowering

136
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,700
learning barriers, I just
really love doing it.

137
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,470
And also including artwork
into course materials

138
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,090
can really help
students understand

139
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,770
that, yes, creativity
and artwork have

140
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,700
a place in science.

141
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,480
Even though I knew
those things, there

142
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,900
was always this little gremlin
on my shoulder saying, OK,

143
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,020
you can lean hard into
the artwork for R&amp;D

144
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,450
to science education,
but just know

145
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,620
that that might actually damage
your credibility as a data

146
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,270
scientist.

147
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,460
And there is a
turning point when

148
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,340
I realized that this
was totally unfounded.

149
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,550
And that was when
Hadley Wickham asked

150
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,640
me to create a series of
illustrations for an upcoming

151
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,750
talk he was giving called The
Joy of Functional Programming.

152
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,120
And I was so excited
because I knew this

153
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,570
was going to be like a big talk,
a really awesome opportunity

154
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,650
to share artwork.

155
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,210
And I was expecting that because
this was a highly professional,

156
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,970
important, advance
talk that this was

157
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,970
going to be maybe some
sleek designs I was creating

158
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,770
to go along with the slides.

159
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,650
And to my absolute
delight, Hadley,

160
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,680
when I asked him what style
he was thinking about,

161
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,250
he responded that he was
thinking about these monsters

162
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,547
being included in this series.

163
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,630
And I tried to play it
cool and be like, oh, yeah,

164
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,830
of course the monsters
would belong in there.

165
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,550
But in my heart I was
just like, oh my gosh!

166
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,070
The monsters have
made it, and this

167
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,350
is like cute artwork being
invited to be at the top level

168
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,790
talks in R and data science.

169
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,210
Not only were the
monsters invited,

170
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,090
but they were going to be
baking cupcakes in this series.

171
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,680
So really capturing for me this
idea that cute and credible

172
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,710
are not at odds with each
other, that including cute

173
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,800
illustrations can be a
really powerful teaching

174
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,110
tool at any level.

175
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,860
I think the one example that
captures this so perfectly is

176
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,830
the certified trainer badge from
RStudio, which is one adorable,

177
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,840
but two is the badge that's used
when the certified trainers get

178
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,790
their certification,
which are some

179
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,250
of the top educators
in the R community.

180
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,780
And this has been a theme
that has been reinforced

181
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,600
with pretty much every
interaction I've had,

182
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,080
both with RStudio
and in the R community

183
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,930
is that there is a
refreshing lack of ego

184
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,020
about what educational
materials look like.

185
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,260
And everyone is always just
welcoming and encouraging

186
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,770
more approachable
educational resources.

187
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,460
What that means is
that, while I started

188
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,740
with this little
gremlin on my shoulder

189
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,380
questioning my credibility
and bringing a lot of doubt

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,880
into my mind,

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,480
what I have now is the
same gremlin which is now

192
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,160
encouraging me
and always asking,

193
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,390
can I actually make this
more approachable or cuter

194
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,040
somehow?

195
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,200
The second big thing
that I've learned

196
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,660
from the R community
over the past year

197
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,960
is that art truly can be a
useful teaching and learning

198
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,810
tool that helps learners
engage with and remember

199
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,310
new functions.

200
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,010
An example of the type of
artwork I've been creating

201
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,580
is this illustration for
the string squish function.

202
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,970
And the job of string squish
is to remove leading, trailing,

203
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,480
and repeated interior
white space from strings.

204
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,580
And here we see
these four monsters

205
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,470
who are working together
to squish this string.

206
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,190
And in doing so are
ejecting excess white space.

207
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,870
This combination of having text
and something verbally explain

208
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,740
and also an illustration showing
what that function is doing I

209
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,080
think is a powerful combination
that can help with retention.

210
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,640
An example of this
happening in the wild

211
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,400
is this illustration
that was trying

212
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,670
to help people
remember to use ungroup

213
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,390
if they have used
group by previously.

214
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,550
We have in the
forefront two monsters

215
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,000
who are at a birthday party, and
you could see that one of them

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,510
has received this
amazing gift of group by.

217
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,710
But more importantly
for this illustration,

218
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,610
we can see in the background
this other little monster

219
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,210
holding ungroup group as a
gift who is just so hoping

220
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,890
they're going to be included.

221
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,200
And the reaction to
this illustration

222
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,750
was exactly what I was
hoping it would be,

223
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,350
which is an emotional reaction
ensuring that people will not

224
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,850
forget ungroup.

225
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,680
For example, some
of the responses

226
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,160
were, "I'm so sad for that
little bub being left out.

227
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,310
I'm always going to remember
this when using ungroup.

228
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,980
I'm never going to look
down on ungroup again."

229
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,930
And my favorite
one is someone who

230
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,630
said they were just able
to help someone else solve

231
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,990
a problem because they
remembered the super cute

232
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,680
and somewhat sad drawing.

233
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,140
I think this really reflects
that artwork can be a way

234
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,330
to engage people's
emotions that helps

235
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,190
them remember important skills.

236
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,760
Art can also be really
useful in helping to clarify

237
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,290
big or vague concepts.

238
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,430
For example, I recently
worked with Julia Lowndes

239
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,060
on a series of
illustrations to try

240
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,690
to portray the
benefits of working

241
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,430
with tidy data, an organizing
data in a tidy data structure.

242
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,380
And what this
illustration is showing

243
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,970
is that if you have data sets
that are all in tidy structure

244
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,790
that you can use the same
tools in similar ways

245
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,220
across data sets.

246
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,860
But in contrast, if
we have untidy data.

247
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,970
What that means is we
oftentimes are hacking together

248
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:15,270
unique tools to deal
with unique data sets

249
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,990
in their own unique ways, which
is challenging and tedious

250
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,997
and makes it hard to
collaborate with people.

251
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:23,580
So I think that this
series was really

252
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,340
useful in taking some
kind of big picture ideas

253
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,910
about the benefits of tidy
data and capturing them

254
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,770
in a way that is more
memorable visually.

255
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,170
Artwork can also
make things that

256
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,210
are kind of intimidating
for learners,

257
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,610
feel a little bit more
friendly, and provide

258
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,010
a more welcoming entry way.

259
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,130
For example, for loops
usually aren't the thing

260
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,190
that learners are the
most excited to learn.

261
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,870
But they're especially
intimidating

262
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,440
when it's just like sequences
of numbers and the code

263
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,730
coming in and out that's a
little bit daunting to look at.

264
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,730
So what if instead there
could be a vector that's

265
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,010
actually a parade of monsters.

266
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,590
And in going through
that for loop,

267
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,810
depending on the
shape of the monster,

268
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,180
they are either assigned
to get sunglasses or a hat,

269
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,090
and then what we can
see is the outcome

270
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,330
is the result of each
of those monsters going

271
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,060
through that for loop and
either getting their sunglasses

272
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,260
or hat.

273
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,060
And the third thing
that I've learned

274
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,980
is that art can be an incredibly
powerful tool for creating

275
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,020
supportive communities.

276
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,180
As a landscape
painter originally, I

277
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,140
did not understand how
important this could be.

278
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:42,330
But art can be a way to directly
show support for learners.

279
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,740
It can show empathy.

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,190
For example, here we see
this little bud who is just

281
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,420
needing to take a minute.

282
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,150
So it can be really
useful for showing empathy

283
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,920
when learners are
maybe struggling

284
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,830
or feeling alone in the
struggles that they're facing.

285
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,110
It can be a way to
engage the community

286
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,840
by creating activities
that include artwork.

287
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,820
For example, with
these coloring book

288
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,310
illustrations of
"R session aborted"

289
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:09,460
and everyone's favorite
"object of type closure

290
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,020
is not subsettable."

291
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,930
And it can also just
be a really cool way

292
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,910
that different groups
and communities

293
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,470
can represent
themselves and make

294
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,360
other people feel included.

295
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
The most common way
that we see this

296
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,340
is in the many hex
stickers that exist

297
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,890
that different groups,
organizations, and even

298
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,720
packages are used to
represent themselves.

299
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,850
And I had no idea before joining
the R community the power

300
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,160
that a 2 inch by 1.73 inch
hexagonal design could have.

301
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,260
And this is something
that I was so

302
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,880
amazed by is the support
and demand for hex stickers

303
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,730
that I think really reflects
how excited people are

304
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,180
to have something that they
can put on their computer

305
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,880
or whatever to represent
themselves and the groups

306
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,950
that they're a part of.

307
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,040
So in summary, what I've
learned over the past year

308
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,040
and that has been reinforced
by so many people in the R

309
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,770
community is that
creative contributions

310
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,860
can make coding and
R a more welcoming

311
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,190
or even just a more fun
place for learners and users

312
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,720
at all levels.

313
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,830
And knowing that what can
we do to create and support

314
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,290
more art in R?

315
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,050
The first thing is we
can find ways to support

316
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,730
creative contributions.

317
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,760
So whatever level
makes sense for you,

318
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,120
how can you support artists
and creative contributors?

319
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,730
Just by watching this
talk you are supporting

320
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,620
creative contributions.

321
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,690
But you can also include artwork
in your teaching resources.

322
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,490
You can like or share artwork
that's posted on Twitter.

323
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,410
Whatever level
makes sense for you,

324
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,240
I guarantee that
your support will

325
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,070
be meaningful for
an artist and will

326
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,820
make them want to create more.

327
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,620
The second is you
could think about ways

328
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,860
to more formally collaborate
with creative contributors.

329
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,320
For example, can you
contract an artist

330
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,720
to add something
to your resources?

331
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,740
Can you write an artist into a
grant that you're working on?

332
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,260
Or can you create an
artist-in-residence program

333
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,680
where I guarantee you will
have your work reflected

334
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,080
in a way that's really
engaging for people

335
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,370
who might not have otherwise
known about or engaged with it?

336
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,250
And finally, I would ask you
to think about ways that you

337
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,620
can be a creative contributor.

338
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,870
So what do you do
that you might be

339
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,960
able to share with
the community?

340
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,090
We already have this
amazing community of people.

341
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:40,520
And so many of them are creating
and sharing incredible artwork

342
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,620
and fabric and R generated
designs, 3D renderings,

343
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,860
amazing graphic
designs made in ggplot,

344
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,860
and so many other things.

345
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,080
And we should think about
what other types of artwork

346
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,170
or creative contributions
would we want to invite.

347
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,780
And the answer should
be all of them.

348
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,960
Baking, music and
sculpture, dance.

349
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,609
There is someone
in the world who

350
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,300
can do the perfect interpretive
dance of pivot_longer

351
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,569
and pivot_wider, and I
want to experience that.

352
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,500
Memes, design, poetry, art
in activities, and so much

353
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,760
more so that we can
be creating artwork

354
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,000
and creative contributions
that engage and resonate

355
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,008
with every different R user who
we would want to feel included.

356
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,800
And sometimes I think
there's this pressure

357
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,380
if you're thinking about
what can I contribute?

358
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,410
There can sometimes
be pressure to feel

359
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,660
like there has to be
some learning outcome

360
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,230
or somebody has to have a
take away or a new skill.

361
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,720
And I encourage you to
remember that making

362
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,390
someone feel a little bit
happier while they're trying

363
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,020
to learn something hard is
an absolutely great reason

364
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,480
to create and share your art.

365
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,070
One experience that
I had with this

366
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,890
recently was I was having
kind of a rough day.

367
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,260
I was mope scrolling
through Twitter,

368
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,670
and I happened to come across
Jacqueline Nolis' picture of the R

369
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,040
pancakes that she had created.

370
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,500
And this didn't solve
my coding problems,

371
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,570
this didn't write
my lecture for me,

372
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,500
but what it did do is it
made me exclaim, R pancakes!

373
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,860
And then I just continued on
my day a little bit happier

374
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,650
because R pancakes had
existed in the world.

375
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,570
So to wrap up, no, art
is not the solution

376
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,120
to tech's problems,
especially related

377
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,330
to inclusion and welcoming.

378
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,660
Unless we're talking about
this whale tail sculpture that

379
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,180
is literally saving a
train that's gone off

380
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,130
the end of the
tracks, art is not

381
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,320
going to save tech,
which is why I'm

382
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,050
so grateful for the
many organizations

383
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,260
groups, individuals, and
initiatives just some of which

384
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,890
are shown here that have been
doing this hard work to make R

385
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,100
more welcoming for more
users since before I even

386
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,080
started using R.

387
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,840
So while art is not
the solution, I

388
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,540
hope that it can be a
supporting piece that

389
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,740
helps those efforts by making
the entire landscape of R,

390
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,730
which is already so vibrant
even a little bit sunnier.

391
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,950
I look forward to
talking with many of you

392
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,480
about all the
different ways we can

393
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,020
contribute more creative
things to the R community.

394
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,960
Thank you.
