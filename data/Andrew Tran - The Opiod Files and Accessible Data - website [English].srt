1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,910
Hi, my name is
Andrew Ba Tran, and I'm

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,618
a data reporter for
the Washington Post's

3
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:10,640
investigative team.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,670
And I'm here to talk
about the opioid files

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,219
and how we investigated
pharmaceutical companies,

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,340
and the government, and
made data accessible to all.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,350
This is a two-week-year-old boy
in an isolation ward in West

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,500
Virginia.

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,120
Any sound seriously disturbs
him and he won't stop crying,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,330
and that's because he was
born addicted to opioids.

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,000
And he is one among
thousands of children

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,040
separated from the
parents and families

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,370
and forced into state care
by an opioid epidemic that

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,850
has fractured families in
every corner of the country.

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,690
In West Virginia alone,
more than 5,200 lives

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,500
over the past three
decades have been lost.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,960
And we've seen the
effects of this.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,250
We know that the
number of children

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,250
in foster care in West
Virginia has doubled ever

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,440
since the epidemic started.

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,209
And other effects that
we've been able to see

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,660
are the death rates in
communities across the country.

23
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,580
In West Virginia, we can see
the effects of the opioid death

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,120
rates and we can also
see that there were also

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,610
higher rates of child
abuse and neglect claims

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,067
in those same areas.

27
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,650
State officials say
that more than 80%

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,750
of children in
foster care have been

29
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,950
affected by the drug epidemic.

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,290
So we've seen the effects.

31
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,470
We've never really been able
to see the causes before,

32
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,750
not with a lot of specificity.

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,730
The thing is, pharmaceutical
companies and the Drug

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,230
Enforcement
Administration have been

35
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,970
able to see this
for the longest time

36
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,720
because every single pill a
manufacturer, the distributor,

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:54,020
the pharmacy is
tracked in the dataset

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,090
and it's called the automated
reports and consolidated order

39
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,590
system.

40
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,510
And the Drug Enforcement
Administration

41
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:08,130
is also under the
Department of Justice.

42
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,060
And in fact, because
prescription pain pills are

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,490
scheduled-2 drug which means it
has a high potential for abuse,

44
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,190
with use potentially leading
to severe psychological and

45
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,760
physical dependence.

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,070
And we call it ARCOS for short.

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,290
And so pharmaceutical
companies and the government

48
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,940
have known the
scope of this data

49
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,700
for the longest time, the reach
of the spread of these pills.

50
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,200
And journalists and
researchers have

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,500
tried to get this dataset
for the longest time as well.

52
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,250
But we've only been able to
get it at the aggregate level,

53
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,170
maybe by state, maybe by
county, maybe by zip code,

54
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,665
maybe by overall
drug, but we've never

55
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:53,540
been able to get it at
the raw data set level

56
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,080
where we could really dig
into the nuances of the data.

57
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,280
Every time we've made a request
for it, it's been denied.

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,830
That is until recently.

59
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,360
So for context, the
most powerful people

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,198
in the pharmaceutical America
didn't want it released.

61
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:14,740
And a lot of the
most powerful people

62
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,560
in the Department of Justice
didn't want this data released.

63
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,130
However, when 2,000
communities across the US

64
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,200
sued dozens of
big drug companies

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,810
over the destruction the
painkillers were causing

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,590
across the country,
a federal judge

67
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,240
ordered that the
article's dataset

68
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,630
be made available to those
plaintiffs for examination.

69
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,080
However, they sealed
it away from the public

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,820
and from the media.

71
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,650
And so The Washington
Post as well as

72
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,590
the Charleston Gazette Mail
sued for access to that data.

73
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,628
And so we appealed the decision.

74
00:03:51,628 --> 00:03:53,170
And a group of
appellate judges ruled

75
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,250
that the protective order on the
ARCOS data should be amended.

76
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,290
And in fact, they released
data from 2006 to 2012,

77
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,020
and eventually 2014.

78
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,020
And so we got our hands on the
data the day it was released.

79
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,380
And what we found out was
that the dataset was huge.

80
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,370
It had about 42 columns
which isn't too bad,

81
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,320
but it had literally
hundreds of millions

82
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,310
of rows of data for every pain
pill order sold between 2006

83
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,422
and eventually 2014.

84
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:28,880
And so the team of us, there
are about three data reporters

85
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,620
including myself.

86
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,560
We used a mix of different
statistical analyzing languages

87
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,460
like Python and
R. And so in order

88
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,340
to maintain great
communication between the two,

89
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,350
we used data
structures that could

90
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,630
operate between the two
languages such as Parquet

91
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,180
and Feather.

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,790
And because the
datasets were so huge,

93
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,140
we use packages like doParallel
in order to handle all that.

94
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,310
And in order to exchange
our analyses, methodologies,

95
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,570
and reports, we wrote up
everything in Jupyter notebooks

96
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,400
or R Markdown.

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,110
I also created Shiny app so that
we could investigate and dig

98
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,340
into pharmacies that
looked suspicious,

99
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,410
because any way you might
slice it would raise

100
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,980
a different set of
pharmacies that might have

101
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,330
set off some suspicious orders.

102
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,540
And so this dataset
was revelatory

103
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,000
because it showed
where each pill moved

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,397
from manufacturer to distributor
to pharmacy for the first time.

105
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:38,980
And so we could see
everything both in

106
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,840
aggregate and fine detail,
and this is what we found out.

107
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,090
We could see that 100 billion
pills saturated the country

108
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,262
between 2006 and 2014.

109
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:53,220
And pharmaceutical
companies from manufacturers

110
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,410
to distributors to pharmacies
made billions of dollars

111
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,290
a year.

112
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,830
We could finally
see the connection

113
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,230
between the deaths
from opioids and how

114
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,795
they soared in communities that
were flooded with pain pills.

115
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:08,670
And we saw the highest
per capita death rates

116
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,670
nationwide were in rural
West Virginia, Kentucky,

117
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,370
and Virginia.

118
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,250
And we could see that just
six companies distributed

119
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,230
76% of the pills
during this period.

120
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,450
And we could drill down into
an individual drug companies

121
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,700
and pharmacy companies
like Walgreens,

122
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,310
where we noticed that at
the height of the crisis,

123
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,280
Walgreens sold about nearly
one out of five of the most

124
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,100
addictive opioids, and that
they had a really, really

125
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,660
interesting company structure.

126
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,130
They not only had a franchise
of pharmacies out there,

127
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,160
they also owned the
distribution company as well.

128
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,190
So it was very much vertical
integration all the way.

129
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,180
So while a lot of mom
and pop pharmacies

130
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,800
could argue that
they didn't really

131
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,420
know exactly the impact of
all of the surge in orders

132
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,440
for opioids in their pharmacy,
Walgreens knew exactly how much

133
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,440
and where these
pills were going.

134
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,090
And so we went to the
effort of geocoding

135
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,250
200,000 or so pharmacies so
that we could put on a map

136
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,440
and then really analyze
geographic patterns that way.

137
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,000
And we made it interactive.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,750
That allowed people to
search their local pharmacy

139
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,990
and see the scale
of sales they did

140
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,303
compared to their neighbors.

141
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:41,720
And so we could really drill
down an individual pharmacies

142
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,580
like this one in Florida.

143
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,082
This is a Walgreens in Florida.

144
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:50,540
And what's important
to really note

145
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,540
is that it was the law
for these companies

146
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,760
to implement in an
effective system

147
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,060
for monitoring their opioid
sales for suspicious orders.

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,960
And so we found
so many pharmacies

149
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,190
that violated those suspicious
orders but kept selling anyway.

150
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,160
This is an example of a
store North of Florida

151
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,340
where starting in 2011,
sales started spiking.

152
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,890
You can see, it's
declined a little bit

153
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,530
after legislators
passed a bill to limit

154
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,590
the sales for a specific
type of oxycodone,

155
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,580
and which slowed it for a
month until customers realized

156
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,040
they could order a different
type of milligrams strength

157
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,350
and get that much easier.

158
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:35,460
And so that started spiking
even more, exponentially.

159
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,700
It got so bad that a
police chief in that town

160
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,330
make so many arrests that he
wrote a message to Walgreens'

161
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,200
executives, begging them
to change their policies

162
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,070
and to restrict it more, and
to not sell the people who

163
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,570
had been previously arrested for
selling opioids on the street,

164
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,520
and to stop selling
to people who

165
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,190
have been rejected
from other pharmacies

166
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,490
with the same prescription.

167
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,105
But you can see, it
stopped for maybe a month

168
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:06,480
or slowed down
for about a month,

169
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,640
until it started growing
in sales once again.

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,150
And it wasn't until around
2012 that sales finally stop

171
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,700
slowing, started slowing down.

172
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,650
But that was when
they started realizing

173
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,100
that the DEA was investigating
several stores as well

174
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,020
as distribution center.

175
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,380
Until eventually, that
store was suspended.

176
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,500
And then the distribution
center itself

177
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,400
in Florida that
also got suspended,

178
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,880
you can see here that it
sent billions of pills

179
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,350
a month to Walgreens
stores across the southeast

180
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,640
and Florida.

181
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,940
But you can see here,
thanks to the data,

182
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,380
that even though they had
been halted starting in 2012,

183
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,870
that another distribution
center stepped up

184
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,290
to fill those orders that
this particular distribution

185
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,030
center stopped handling.

186
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,300
So Walgreens barely
slowed down their sales.

187
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,930
What was interesting about
this dataset and the story

188
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,990
that we did was that
we made the data widely

189
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,860
available to the public and we
put out explicit instructions

190
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,080
on how to use the data as well.

191
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,500
Because the thing
is, the dataset

192
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,980
was so huge that there was more
stories that we could possibly

193
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,980
tell by ourselves.

194
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,780
And the data could be applied
to specific communities

195
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,000
to see what they thought
was more interesting

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,870
and applied to them.

197
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,150
And so in the first
main page where

198
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,465
you could see the results
of the opioid sales

199
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,090
across the country,
there was a section

200
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,940
where folks could
navigate and find

201
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,718
their state and their county,
and see exactly how many pills

202
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:58,010
were sold there, which were
the top distributors, which

203
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,820
were the top manufacturers,
which were the top pharmacies,

204
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,460
and get the numbers for them.

205
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,720
And not only that, get generated
views specific to their county

206
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,360
and also the summarized tables,
as well as the raw data itself,

207
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,270
if they wanted to do
more deeper analysis.

208
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,150
On top of that, we took that
data and we used Plumber

209
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,410
to create an API out of it.

210
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,910
And what was great
about Plumber is

211
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,510
that with very little
coding, it will self

212
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,260
generate some great
documentation behind this data

213
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,250
portal.

214
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,710
We also created an R
wrapper around it four more

215
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,020
ease, for the special R users.

216
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,610
And then a researcher
at Maryland

217
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,007
saw this and reached out and
went and made a Python package

218
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:50,840
around this as well.

219
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,605
And on top of that, we created
a bunch of vignettes and walk

220
00:11:57,605 --> 00:12:01,920
tours so that folks could see
exactly how we did our work,

221
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,800
but also figure out
how to tell stories

222
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,760
relevant to their
communities as well.

223
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,800
And we included functionality
in the package to slice

224
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,200
out the data beyond what we had
done in our stories ourselves,

225
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,890
such as being able to
look at individual drugs

226
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,270
and the dataset.

227
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,440
For our stories, we focused
on oxycodone and hydrocodone,

228
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,400
but there are 12 other drugs
in this data set from ARCOS

229
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,410
that we didn't even look at.

230
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,730
The map on the right visualizes
all the methadone sales

231
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,230
in Boston.

232
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,000
It's this area called
Methadone Mile.

233
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,760
And we made it into
a bunch of functions,

234
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,300
include a bunch of functions
that we anticipated

235
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,183
people would find
useful, such as bringing

236
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:54,350
in the latitude and longitude
for all the pharmacies

237
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,790
that we looked up.

238
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,780
We brought in population
tables for state, county,

239
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,670
and all the years the
data was available so

240
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,930
that folks could
normalize it well.

241
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,620
And also all the
summarized tables,

242
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,830
because it was important
to make data accessible.

243
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,010
It wasn't just enough to
put a dataset on GitHub,

244
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,820
or put a link out there, and
then let people go through it

245
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,060
themselves and figure out
how do it, deal with it,

246
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,400
which researchers
are great at doing.

247
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,630
They can create so many great
research projects around it

248
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,570
such as the effects of the
opioid epidemic on the housing

249
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,500
market, for example.

250
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,690
But we went through the effort
of allowing many doorways

251
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,140
to this data, through the API,
through the browser itself

252
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,770
on that main page,
so that any one

253
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,530
with any level of-- with
different levels of expertise

254
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,930
could access this data.

255
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,620
And sometimes it
can convert others

256
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,050
to R, which I find is a success.

257
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,150
So after we put all
that data out there,

258
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,910
we found out that within a
few days, hundreds of stories

259
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,630
were written by
local journalists,

260
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,120
and it was amazing.

261
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,180
For example, the Cleveland
Plain Dealer looked at the data

262
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,810
and found that there was one
particular small-town doctor

263
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,560
that was responsible for selling
1.6 million pills which helped

264
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,570
fuel the surge there in Ohio.

265
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,810
A radio station, WOSU,
looked at the data

266
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,672
and decided to
focus on the victims

267
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,880
and telling their stories
as all the stories of those

268
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,400
who were left behind.

269
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,080
The Daily Union in
Wisconsin looked at the data

270
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,640
and tracked down the businesses
who are selling the most pills,

271
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,090
and then went to see how
much they had donated

272
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,450
to politicians and to whom.

273
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,510
The Philadelphia Inquirer
made some great interactive

274
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,040
visualizations that showed
how after oxycodone was

275
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,400
reformulated so that it was
not as crushable and snortable,

276
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,730
that the demand for
different types of oxycodone

277
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,990
surged instead.

278
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,210
And through the data,
we were able to look

279
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:18,640
at manufacturers in a new way.

280
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,600
So while Purdue got all the
attention based on the data,

281
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,230
we could see that they
only controlled about 3%

282
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,900
of the opioid market.

283
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,510
And that three lesser-known
generic drug manufacturers

284
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,470
actually manufactured most
of the addictive pills.

285
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,420
However, since they
weren't well-known,

286
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,450
they avoided DEA's
scrutiny for many years.

287
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,210
Journalists also
saw through the data

288
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,020
that lawmakers were
involved in this.

289
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,490
One lawmaker in
Louisiana, a House member,

290
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,730
owned two pharmacies that
were 12.5 miles apart

291
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,390
from each other in a town
that serves 6,000 people

292
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:07,060
but sold 1.5 million
pills in that time period.

293
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,760
Another legislator
that journalists

294
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,640
found in the dataset was a state
representative in Tennessee

295
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,940
who was president and CEO of
the largest orderers of opioids

296
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,140
in the state.

297
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,870
And what journalists
connected with that

298
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,340
was that earlier in the year,
this particular state lawmaker,

299
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,760
Shane Reeves,
actually introduced

300
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,730
and helped pass a law
that made it easier

301
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,452
to access opioid prescriptions.

302
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,090
And so as a result of
all this, four companies

303
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,460
that made or distributed
prescription opioids

304
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,420
and played roles and the
catastrophic opioid crisis

305
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,440
have reached a
tentative $26 billion

306
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,693
settlement with counties
and cities that sued them

307
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:54,360
for damages in the
largest federal court

308
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,810
case in American history.

309
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,640
And internal
documents of all this

310
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,160
showed that the pressure
within the drug companies

311
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,170
to sell opioids were in
conflict with numerous red flags

312
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,560
from the DEA and even
internal workers.

313
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,232
But the profiteers are huge
that sales didn't slow down,

314
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:17,690
and we're still
feeling the effects

315
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:23,087
to this day in a different way.

316
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:25,670
Prescription pain pills were the
main cause of overdose deaths

317
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,410
through 2011.

318
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,892
But then after the laws were
passed, after pharmacies caught

319
00:17:31,892 --> 00:17:34,350
on, after doctors caught on,
and started restricting access

320
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,990
to prescription pain
pills, drug users

321
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,290
then turned to heroin, which
set the stage for fentanyl.

322
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,110
And together, oxycodone,
hydrocodone, heroin,

323
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,450
and fentanyl have killed
more than 400,000 Americans

324
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,650
since the turn of the
century, a quarter of whom

325
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,800
have died from fentanyl in
just the last six years.

326
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,420
So I'm not exactly sure
how to wrap up this talk,

327
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,550
but I want to point out that I
hope the data that should have

328
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,900
been kept an eye on by
pharmaceutical companies,

329
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,440
by the government,
and that's finally

330
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,120
made it into the hands of
the public, the researchers,

331
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,300
and journalists
out there, I hope

332
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,210
we're able to hold
everyone more accountable

333
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,305
so that we can prevent
more foster care children.

334
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,280
Anyway, that's my talk.

335
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,660
Thanks so much for listening.
