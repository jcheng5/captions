NICK PYLYPIW: I'm
Nick Pylypiw, director

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,290
of data science at
Cape Fear Collective,

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,690
and today I'd like to talk to
you about our racial equity

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,380
dashboard.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,790
Cape Fear Collective
is a nonprofit based

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,560
in Wilmington, North Carolina.

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,500
We're committed to using our
expertise in data science

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,480
to support front-line
organizations

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,570
in Southeastern North Carolina
in their fight against poverty,

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,840
racism, poor health
and education outcomes,

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,970
and socioeconomic disparities.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,350
Though we are
primarily an R shop,

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,000
we also use Tableau,
ArcGIS, Python, and SQL

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,110
in our analytics ecosystem
as we ingest, store, analyze,

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,705
and socialize data from a
variety of public and partner

17
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:05,205
sources.

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,940
Our racial equity dashboard
is built in Shiny and ggplot.

19
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,550
The framework houses
tabs as separate modules

20
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,120
for each category
of data stories.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,310
The landing page contains
a brief introduction

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,850
to the dashboard itself,
our email address,

23
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,970
and the tab navigation
bar for the data story

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,320
categories across the top.

25
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:38,640
Each of these tabs
follows the same format,

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,880
a brief introduction to
the category followed

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,745
by two to five
visualizations and stories.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,860
Let's walk through one
of those stories now.

29
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,890
The definition box tells us
that pregnancy-related mortality

30
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,410
ratio, which is
pregnancy-related deaths

31
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,980
per 100,000 live
births is often used

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,840
as an indicator of
a nation's health.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,320
The expandable explanation
box gives the viewer

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,520
additional context about how to
interpret the visualization.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,430
This plot shows a 30-year
trend of the pregnancy related

36
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,380
mortality ratio
of the US compared

37
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,960
to select economic peers.

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,370
Though these five nations began
in the '90s at the same level,

39
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,040
the US has since
deviated from the pack,

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,550
nearly tripling its
maternal mortality.

41
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,000
The country is currently
56th in the world.

42
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,040
We often hear of
pregnancy-related complications

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,690
due to age.

44
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,120
For White mothers,
this risk becomes

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,070
apparent around 35 years old.

46
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,180
In Black mothers, the
increase starts much earlier.

47
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,500
The resulting gap means
Black women aged 40 or older

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,780
have a pregnancy-related
mortality ratio

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,380
almost four times that
of their White peers.

50
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,170
Educational attainment is
another indicator of disparity.

51
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,210
A college education
appears to correlate

52
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,160
with a lower
pregnancy-related mortality

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,290
ratio for a White
woman but has little

54
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,000
to no impact for a Black woman.

55
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,520
Looking specifically
at North Carolina,

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,180
we were able to identify a
road map of interventions

57
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,550
based on high-risk
pregnancy factors

58
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,310
and have shared these with
our community partners.

59
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,640
For example, increased access
to prenatal care and pregnancy

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,550
testing would have a
significant impact on pregnancy

61
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,750
related mortality ratio.

62
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,470
Over the next
several months, we'll

63
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,810
be aligning our
community data platform

64
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,640
including insights
from this racial equity

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,630
dashboard with the statewide
Healthy North Carolina 2030

66
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,880
initiative.

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,790
This will allow us to set
attainable, data-driven,

68
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,810
local goals with a focus on
equity and accountability

69
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,486
through shared measurement.

70
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,190
I invite you to explore
the rest of the dashboard

71
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,589
and to visit our website to
learn more about the work

72
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,990
we are doing in the
Cape Fear region.

73
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,030
Please also contact me
if you're interested

74
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,550
in volunteer
opportunities, contributing

75
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,260
to our social impact
investment fund,

76
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,840
or if you just want to
chat about the data.

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,940
Thank you.
