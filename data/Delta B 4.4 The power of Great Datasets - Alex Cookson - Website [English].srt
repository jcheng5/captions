00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,950
Hi, I'm Alex
Cookson and I'd like

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,880
to talk about the power
of great datasets.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,320
I'd like to start off this
talk by posing a question

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,240
that I think all of us have
asked ourselves at one point

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,710
and that is, how do I learn
to do this thing in R?

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,380
Whether that's sentiment
analysis, or data

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,990
visualization, or web scraping,
how do we learn something?

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,439
And Allison Horst who does a
lot of wonderful illustrations

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,760
about R and statistics has one
that answers this question.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,900
And it shows how teachers,
mentors, and the wonderful R

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,900
stats community all
contribute to taking someone

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,810
from being a beginner to
some level of proficiency

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,440
with something.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,900
But I always look
at this illustration

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:57,413
and ask myself, what
about great datasets?

16
00:00:57,413 --> 00:00:58,830
Now when I say
great datasets, I'm

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,970
talking about something
pretty specific.

18
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,260
I'm talking about datasets that
are both cool and interesting.

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,577
And when I say cool,
I mean something

20
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,910
that when you come across
that you say to yourself, hey,

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,040
that's cool or
that's really fun.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,790
It's something that speaks
to you on a deeper level

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,920
and it tends to be
pretty personal.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,230
So what's cool to you
might not be cool to me.

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,050
And when I say
interesting, I mean

26
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,940
that it rouses your curiosity.

27
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,520
It makes you start asking
a whole bunch of questions

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,857
that you really
want the answer to.

29
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:31,440
If you ever played a video game
where you say to yourself just

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,750
five more minutes
or one more turn

31
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,880
and you're still playing
it an hour later,

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,410
this is the dataset version
of that, just one more graph.

33
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,600
So some examples that I enjoy
are the Duke Lemur Center

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
dataset which looks at
ages and weights of almost

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,940
30 different species of Lemur.

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,770
The Broadway Grosses
dataset which

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,920
looks at weekly box office
grosses, tickets sold,

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,170
average top ticket
prices of Broadway

39
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,810
shows going back to 1985.

40
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,520
And fictional
character personalities

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,350
which I consider to
be one of the all

42
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,479
time greatest of great datasets.

43
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,660
And this one looks
at personality traits

44
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,750
of 800 fictional
characters across over 250

45
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,680
different spectrums, such as the
playful to serious spectrum,

46
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,930
where we might find Michael
Scott from The Office

47
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,690
on the playful side,
and Worf from Star Trek:

48
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,453
Next Generation way over
on the serious side.

49
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,120
And I think this is
such a great dataset

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,257
because I've been watching
so much TV and so many movies

51
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:35,340
lately that when I came
across that I thought, Oh,

52
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,460
this is so fun.

53
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,540
It's something that
speaks to, something

54
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,290
I've been spending a
lot of my time doing.

55
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,780
And I immediately had
tons and tons of questions

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,980
that I wanted to ask it and
uncover from this dataset.

57
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,170
One of those questions
was, what are

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,743
some of my favorite
characters personalities?

59
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:53,160
And I put in a
whole bunch of work

60
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,577
and ended up with
some graphs that

61
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:58,410
looked like this which takes
the six characters from Pride

62
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,570
and Prejudice and shows
their strongest traits.

63
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,110
So we see that Elizabeth
Bennet at the top left

64
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,380
is a treasure as
opposed to trash.

65
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,760
She's important,
she has a high IQ,

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,120
she's independent, and
beautiful, and a feminist.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,760
But to put this
together, I had to learn

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,150
to do a whole bunch of things
I didn't know how to do before

69
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,780
like use custom fonts so I
could get this Georgian era

70
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,930
kind of handwriting
vibe, to tweak labels

71
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,200
using the glue and
ggtext packages,

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,700
I had to choose an appropriate
color palette for the subject

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,920
matter, and adjust a ton of
theme elements using ggplot2.

74
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,440
A second question I had
was, which characters

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,360
are most similar to or
different from one another?

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,850
And again I put
in a bunch of work

77
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,630
and ended up with
something like this,

78
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,320
which looks at reasonable
versus derange characters,

79
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,780
plotted against rugged
versus refined characters.

80
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,740
So here we see that characters
like Sandor Clegane and Jayne

81
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,570
Cobb are really
similar to one another.

82
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,040
They're deranged and rugged.

83
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,620
And their opposites are
Charlotte York from Sex

84
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,700
and the City and Annie Edison,
who are reasonable and refined.

85
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,300
And to do this, I had to conduct
principal component analysis

86
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,760
with tidymodels because
these are actually

87
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,880
principal components, you
don't find them in the data.

88
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,280
I had to learn to add
text and arrow annotations

89
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,399
to get this graph here and
I wrote a blog post where

90
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,079
this is an interactive chart.

91
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,400
So I had to learn how to make an
interactive chart using plotly.

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,040
And if I can be honest
with you for a moment,

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,430
I never would have
put this much effort.

94
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,100
This many hours into
analyzing Titanic passengers.

95
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,450
It was because it was such
a great, engaging dataset

96
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,340
where I had tons of
questions that I wanted

97
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,520
the answers to that I had
the drive and the curiosity

98
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,740
to actually get those answers
and learn a whole bunch

99
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,430
of stuff in the process.

100
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,850
So I encourage you to get
your own great datasets.

101
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,150
And to Allison, I
very respectfully

102
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,490
think we may add one
thing to the balloon.

103
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,340
Thank you.
