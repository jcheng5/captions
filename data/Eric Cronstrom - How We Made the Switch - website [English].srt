1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,150
My name is Eric Cronstrom with
the center for charter schools

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,890
at Central Michigan University.

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,219
I'm going to tell you a
story about my first project

4
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,080
after joining the center.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
Now this project
was a challenge,

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,580
but we were able to
automate a process that

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,000
had been performed manually
for more than a decade.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,490
On its own, the
project was successful,

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,410
but we turned it
into an opportunity

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,190
to rethink how the organization
approaches data science.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,460
This is a story about the
technology and the techniques

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,980
we use to automate
a task that seemed

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,330
too complex for the procedural
document generation.

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,310
But more importantly,
this is a story

15
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,730
about how to make a difference
in an organization of how

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,310
to build trust, and
convince leadership

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,430
to try the new thing.

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,150
One of the responsibilities
we have as a charter school

19
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,760
authorizer is to
hold our partner

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,280
schools accountable for
the academic performance

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,870
of their students.

22
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,140
One of the ways we do this is
with the annual performance

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,600
report.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,456
The annual performance
report or APR

25
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:19,080
is a document that
summarizes how well students

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,310
in each of our 58 partner
schools are doing academically.

27
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,860
In the spirit of
transparency, these reports

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,370
are made publicly available
on the centers website.

29
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,730
And they're also
distributed to school boards

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,000
and other stakeholders
as print booklets.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,060
The organization demands
high production values

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,870
for these documents, and they
have to be absolutely correct.

33
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,210
And to make no bones
about it, they look good.

34
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,580
And these publications are
the primary responsibility

35
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,850
of my new job.

36
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,990
So try to picture yourself
at a job interview.

37
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,220
Across the table is
your new potential boss.

38
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,210
He's an impressive guy with
a PhD in psychometrics.

39
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,850
He's explaining how
important these reports are,

40
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,940
and some of what goes
into making them.

41
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,680
But there's a catch.

42
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,890
These reports that usually
take months to produce

43
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,980
have to go to print
in seven weeks.

44
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,820
Well, to quote Richard
Branson, if someone offers you

45
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,040
an amazing opportunity,
but you're not sure

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,160
if you can do it, say yes,
and learn how to do it later.

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,340
So how do you make an APR?

48
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,500
First things first, you
have to get your data.

49
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,400
There are a variety
of different sources,

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,000
individual test scores
from assessment vendors,

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,840
the student information from
the Michigan Department of Ed,

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,160
demographic, and comparison data
from the state and other public

53
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,490
entities, and so on.

54
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,650
Once you download everything,
you load it into the database.

55
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,760
Sometimes, some of it just
stays as flat files.

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,070
After sourcing all
your information,

57
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,760
you can start producing
the visuals with Excel.

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,330
School can have up to 23
different visualizations

59
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,000
depending on the
grade levels offered,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,030
and there are nine different
Excel templates that

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,340
produce all of the
charts, and graphs,

62
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,718
and tables required by the APRs.

63
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:25,070
At this point, any data
that actually made it

64
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,890
into the database
get pulled back out,

65
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,560
and copied into
an Excel template.

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,590
Then you manually output
the correct visuals

67
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,020
for each school
validating the numbers

68
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,210
as you go one at a time
for 23 visuals per school

69
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,670
for 58 schools.

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,270
Now the last link in this
chain was Adobe and design,

71
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,300
where the actual
documents get produced.

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,400
There's a master
report template that

73
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,130
gets updated with a
fresh content every year.

74
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,310
And finally one last script
pulls everything together

75
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,310
to produce one PDF
for each school.

76
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,390
This is where being a
new person helps a bit.

77
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,760
Hiring a new team
member is an opportunity

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,740
to have a fresh set of eyes who
like the proverbial boiled frog

79
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,220
knows right away when they're
dropped into hot water.

80
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,390
Our tight deadline was
also a blessing in disguise

81
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,940
since we knew there
wasn't enough time

82
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,300
to do things the way
they had done before.

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,590
So with only six weeks
left at this point,

84
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,930
we sat down in a conference
room, and hashed out our plan.

85
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,190
This is a picture I took of the
whiteboard after that meeting.

86
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,860
We figured we had three
different potential

87
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,990
path forward, a fully automated
solution built on R, rendering

88
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,380
documents with R Markdown,
or a hybrid solution

89
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,500
where we render
the visuals with R.

90
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,680
But still use InDesign to
pull the documents together.

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,535
I should note that up until
this point, nobody on the team

92
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:05,300
and myself included
had used much R.

93
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,170
Excel was the tool of choice
for data visualization,

94
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,700
and most of any real analysis
was performed in SAS.

95
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,040
So we gave ourselves only
a short amount of time

96
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,680
to experiment with
R. And if we couldn't

97
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,640
have a proof of concept for
production ready visuals in 10

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,190
days, we would use Excel.

99
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,280
And if within a month, we
couldn't have an R Markdown

100
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,160
report that met our
publication standards,

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,660
we would use the
InDesign templates.

102
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,460
Like I said, I hadn't used
much R up until this point.

103
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,780
I was comfortable
with programming.

104
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,190
My background is in software
development and automation.

105
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,420
I had some exposure to R just
through my graduate coursework,

106
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,510
but the only R Markdown
reports I ever created

107
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,960
were academic white papers.

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,860
And looking back, I think
it was this discussion

109
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,760
about the risks involved,
and being open and honest

110
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,630
about what I knew.

111
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,370
And what I didn't know.

112
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,650
And having a backup
plan is how I

113
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,520
was able to convince the
team to try something new.

114
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,185
Now that we had a plan, and
we convinced the organization

115
00:06:15,185 --> 00:06:19,030
to let us experiment, we set
out to recreate this report

116
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,710
from the ground up.

117
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,690
And the first thing
we needed to do

118
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,800
was prove to ourselves that we
could create a publication that

119
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,790
adheres to our identity
standards using R Markdown.

120
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,430
And there was one issue that
almost stopped us right away.

121
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,810
So at this point in my career,
I had been writing code

122
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,970
professionally for 10 years.

123
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,970
I've taught web
development courses.

124
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,720
I've taught database
design at a graduate level.

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,100
The single issue I spent the
most time on for this report

126
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,600
was getting a box with our
CMU maroon background color

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,360
with white text using
a custom font in LaTeX.

128
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,750
Maybe that just stands
out as the most difficult

129
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,780
technical challenge, because
almost everything else

130
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,820
was done with ggplot.

131
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,190
And ggplot is amazing.

132
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,100
Regardless, it's not
my proudest moment.

133
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,380
More seriously
though, the reason

134
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,190
this process had been
performed manually for so long

135
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,660
is that each school
is a little different.

136
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,890
Different schools offer
different grade levels.

137
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,350
Some of our schools
are K through 12,

138
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,280
some are just high schools,
and some are kindergarten

139
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,260
through third grade.

140
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,220
And beyond that, we evaluate
the academic performance

141
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,070
of our schools based
on the terms laid out

142
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,770
in their individual contracts.

143
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,430
The educational goals of many
of our schools are similar,

144
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,480
but some are operating
under unique circumstances.

145
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,190
And all of those
differences need

146
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,250
to be represented in the
annual performance report.

147
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,710
When you're manually
producing visuals in Excel,

148
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,950
you can tweak things on
the fly to accommodate

149
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,700
all those variations
trying to automate around

150
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,180
all that variability,
presents an interesting design

151
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,610
challenge.

152
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,570
There are two main strategies
we employ to accommodate this,

153
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,570
depending on the prevalence
of the variation,

154
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,950
and the impact that
has on the report.

155
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,230
You can always write flow
control logic into your R code,

156
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,450
so your program will
behave differently

157
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,909
depending on what schools report
is currently being rendered.

158
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,900
This is OK if it's a
unique situation that only

159
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,030
impacts one or two schools.

160
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,650
Otherwise, it can get
out of hand quickly.

161
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,850
What we try to do first
is to generalize an issue,

162
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,280
and develop a data
structure that represents

163
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,470
all possible variations.

164
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,590
And effectively, it turns
part of a school's contracts

165
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,136
into data.

166
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:01,430
A good example of
this is you can

167
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,180
have two schools that both
offer instruction at grades K

168
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,820
through 8.

169
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,520
School A's contract
stipulates they're

170
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,120
to be evaluated on the academic
achievement of their students

171
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,810
in grades 3 through 8.

172
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,390
School B's contract
says they are

173
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,390
to be evaluated based on
their students in grades 3

174
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,150
through 7 excluding grade 8.

175
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,970
Instead of a giant if
else chain in your code

176
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,460
to keep track of all
the contract grades,

177
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,770
you can develop a
data structure that

178
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,370
represents that information.

179
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,240
Going through this process,
we identified more problems,

180
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,060
and we were able
to fix right away.

181
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,160
When you have an
aggressive timeline,

182
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,490
you do what you have to
do to get the job done.

183
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,760
And to be fair, we only
gave ourselves six weeks

184
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,970
to learn ggplot,
Markdown, and LaTeX.

185
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,490
The code was never
going to be pretty,

186
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,820
but I'm proud of what we
managed to accomplish.

187
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,570
We met our deadline with
a couple of days to spare.

188
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,170
The new fully automated
reports that look great.

189
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,140
With the push of a button,
an R driver program

190
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,800
renders one report per school
from a single R Markdown

191
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,790
template.

192
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,030
And the best part is it's
completely reproducible.

193
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,520
Next year, we can push
the same button again,

194
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,300
and get the same reports
with updated data.

195
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,180
It is of course until your
communications department

196
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,630
updates their brand identity
standards with new fonts,

197
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,050
and new logos, and new
rules, such is life.

198
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,350
So we sent our reports
out to print on time,

199
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,480
but we knew we weren't done.

200
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,720
We used success with
R in this project

201
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,540
to convince the
organization to invest more

202
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,480
into our data infrastructure.

203
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,520
We just wrapped up
the implementation

204
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,020
of RStudio Connect server,
and we have time carved out

205
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,380
for research and development of
dashboards and other analytics

206
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,640
projects.

207
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,730
My next big project
is a plumber API

208
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,510
that will feed data to a web
app posted on our website.

209
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,370
And gone are the
days of juggling

210
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,720
flat files between projects.

211
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,560
Now, I access data
in my SQL server

212
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,270
directly using R with
dbplyr, which I'm

213
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,030
convinced works on black magic.

214
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,380
Is showing results is what
convinced the organization

215
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,620
to give us the time to
invest in ourselves.

216
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,350
And we started
adopting best practices

217
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,330
around data management
and software development.

218
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,200
Now, all of the data
that we use makes it

219
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,800
into our data warehouse,
and each data pipeline

220
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,250
has an automated integration
services package.

221
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,600
Because as it turns out, Excel
was our ETL tool, as well as

222
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,510
our database tool.

223
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,650
And all of the code and assets
needed to build each solution

224
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,350
are stored in one spot
and source control.

225
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,350
And we're able to spend more
time building, and doing work

226
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,730
that we enjoy.

227
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,510
Because exporting hundreds of
charts from Excel one at a time

228
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,460
is super boring.

229
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,000
And we're able to spend more
time contributing research,

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,580
and at a time when research
in education is critical.

231
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,250
I hope that our story
helps inspire you to take

232
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,200
on your next big project.

233
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Anyone regardless of tenure
or position or job title

234
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,050
can be a leader, you just
need to take the first step.
