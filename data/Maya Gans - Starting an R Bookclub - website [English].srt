00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:06,950
MAYA GANS: Hi.

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,360
My name is Maya Gans.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,190
And in this talk,
I want to tell you

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,950
how to start your own
virtual book club.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,810
So this idea came to me in
the beginning of lockdown.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,830
I found myself
feeling really alone.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,050
And also, scrolling
through Twitter,

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,290
I saw everyone taking on
these new, exciting hobbies.

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,330
Like remember the time
when there were so many

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,980
pictures of sourdough?

11
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,870
So I was looking
at my bookshelf.

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,600
And I saw Advanced
R. And I realized

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,280
that I use as a reference but
I never read it cover to cover.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,340
So I wanted to use the lockdown
opportunity to do that.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,430
And I found myself
asking a lot of questions

16
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,680
that I didn't have
the answers to.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,730
So I reached out to Jon Harmon,
the moderator of the R for Data

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,440
Science Slack channel.

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,320
And he allowed me
to start a book club

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,840
channel within that Slack
and to just see what happens.

21
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,260
And the results were magical.

22
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:07,170
12 of us ended up meeting weekly
for the entirety of the book

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,230
so I think over the
course of 25 weeks.

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,360
And we went from essentially
a group of strangers

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,840
to now a group of
really good friends.

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,000
So first, I want to talk
about the cornerstones of why

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,040
I think that this worked.

28
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,260
And the reasons are twofold.

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,820
We created a microcosm within
an already existing community.

30
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,960
So you might say there's already
R Ladies or other chapters

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,310
and groups out there.

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,540
And that's true.

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,950
But that's thousands of
faceless group members

34
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,890
who albeit are extremely
helpful and inviting

35
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,950
whereas this group was 12 of us
meeting on Zoom with the camera

36
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,570
on and really
humanizing this learning

37
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,260
experience with each other.

38
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,460
The other component was that
we made this as asynchronous

39
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,050
compatible as possible.

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,900
So each meeting was
recorded and put on YouTube.

41
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,680
So if you couldn't attend,
you can watch that.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,720
But we also had this
slack channel for people

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,710
to ask questions and even answer
them whenever they get to them.

44
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,870
So you weren't really
limited and locked down

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,440
to this single hour.

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,680
Now, the meetings themselves
changed over time,

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,050
what we did with them.

48
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,950
In the beginning, we took
the first 30 or so minutes

49
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,570
to review what we
found in the chapter

50
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,230
and then used the rest of
the time to answer questions.

51
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,850
But after a couple weeks,
maybe around week eight

52
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,910
or so, I was getting kind
of bored with this model.

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,300
And I wanted to
make an application.

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,130
I made a Shiny app that uses
the concepts within a chapter.

55
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,630
And granted, the Shiny app was
super buggy, didn't even work.

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,230
But within the hour, we
all debugged it together

57
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,800
and got it up and running.

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,910
And I think that was kind of
a paradigm shift where people

59
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,850
started, rather than just
relaying information,

60
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,170
they showed us their
packages or other creations.

61
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,430
And it was incredibly
inspiring and eye

62
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,740
opening to see how people are
using these fundamentals just

63
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,850
in these chapters.

64
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,790
So now let's get
to the secret sauce

65
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,600
of why I think this
model worked, right?

66
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,310
We're not the first people
to make a book club.

67
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,990
And I think it's
because of two things.

68
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,890
One is that we
have a facilitator

69
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,270
for each of our books.

70
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,920
And in this case, it was me who
granted I'm pretty extroverted.

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,290
And I was totally fine
pinging people on Slack

72
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,360
and being like, hey,
it's Thursday night.

73
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,620
time to meet.

74
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,050
But you don't have
to be that pushy.

75
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,000
Rather, the point
of the facilitator

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,610
is that every week
there is an agenda.

77
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:56,420
And if no one is able to
give that presentation

78
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,820
for that week, then the
onus is on the presenter

79
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,260
to take that upon themselves.

80
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,000
Or else the book might
falter to the wayside.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,830
The other component is
collaborative infrastructure.

82
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,560
And for our case, we used GitHub.

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,910
And this image as well as the
text before this are links.

84
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,300
So feel free to go
out to our GitHub.

85
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,370
But our GitHub
has three folders.

86
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,520
The first is our presentations
so the actual Markdown

87
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,570
presentations from each week.

88
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,660
The second folder contains a
breakdown of all the questions

89
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,090
and answers collated
from the Slack channel

90
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,190
so that you don't have
to sift through that.

91
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,840
And the last folder
is a data folder.

92
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,800
And in this folder, we took
that concept of applications

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,700
and took a data set and drilled
down into it where each chapter

94
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,390
we applied that to this
data set of our own.

95
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,970
Now to talk about side dishes.

96
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:06,170
So when we started this
book club, at the outset,

97
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,170
the goal was essentially learn
the contents of the chapters.

98
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,400
But we ended up learning all of
these external things as well.

99
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,140
So I personally
onboarded people onto how

100
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,290
to use GitHub in a
collaborative sense

101
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,700
and collaborate on
a single project.

102
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,070
We also learned a lot about
R Markdown, HTML, and CSS.

103
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,500
And lastly, and maybe
even most importantly,

104
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,550
we were still leveling up
on our presentation skills

105
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,930
in these times where we're
all isolated and alone.

106
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:44,490
So I want to leave you now
with a recipe card essentially

107
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,690
to recreate this recipe
that worked for us.

108
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:54,480
And the recipe here is kind of I
break it down into seven steps.

109
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,320
The first is pick a book.

110
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,370
What book do you want to learn?

111
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,490
The second is find
an online community

112
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,640
to make this as
asynchronous as possible.

113
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,380
The third is to blast
it on social media.

114
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,390
The fourth is some books
have natural breaks that

115
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,870
might not be the chapters.

116
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,470
So you might chop
them into segments

117
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:25,430
that are logical breaks, and
then take a pulse on the group

118
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,920
and on yourself and
see what's working

119
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,350
in that that precious hour
that you're meeting together.

120
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,600
And don't be afraid
to switch it up.

121
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,460
Then lastly, I think it was
really awesome and fun that we

122
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,860
utilized applications
of the chapter

123
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,050
rather than just
keeping it theoretical.

124
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,630
And of course, in
the end, have fun.

125
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,810
So there's a link to the Slack
channel here because I would

126
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,500
really like if you are going to
create a book club to just let

127
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,690
us know what works
and what didn't.

128
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,000
And thank you so much for
listening to this talk.
